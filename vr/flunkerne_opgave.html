		<h1>Introduction to HTML 5</h1>
		<h3>Tim Berners Lee &amp; the World Wide Web</h3>
		<p>HTML is the "mother tongue" of your browser. To make a long story short, HTML was invented in 1990 by a scientist called <mark>Tim Berners-Lee</mark>. The purpose was to make it easier for scientists at different universities to gain access to each other's research documents. The project became a bigger success than Tim Berners-Lee had ever imagined. By inventing HTML he laid the foundation for the web as we know it today.</p>

		<h2>What is HTML 5?</h2>
		<h3>HTML: The foundation of all websites</h3>
		<p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting <em>structural semantics</em> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML webpages.</p>

		<aside>By the way: HTML is an abbreviation of "HyperText Mark-up Language".</aside>

		<h3>HTML 5: A new standard</h3>
		<p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. A new group of HTML tags enables you to build your web page using a <strong>semantic layout</strong>. This means that logically grouped  sections of your page can have equally logical HTML tags. For example, web page headers and footers can be wrapped in header and footer tags; navigational toolbars can use nav tags; large sections are enclosed in section; and actual content is written within article tags. Producing a web page in this way will make understanding the source code easier for you and easier for automated programs to parse.</p>
